                GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                  Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or
if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get
the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL have two ways to comply with the
license when they modify code and run a modified version on a network
server. The first is to release their modified versions under the GNU
GPL. The second is to refrain entirely from distributing or publishing
the modified work and just let users interact with it remotely.

The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in the latter case, the modified source code becomes
available to the community. It requires the operator of a network
server to provide the source code of the modified version running
there to the users of that server.

The developer who uses the GNU Affero General Public License is one
who aims to encourage cooperation and innovation in a networked
environment. Consequently, it must be possible for developers to
comfortably use their GNU Affero General Public Licensed code with
code licensed under the plain GNU GPL. The two licenses, therefore,
are essentially one and the same, and are written to be explicitly
compatible.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                      TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of
the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means doing anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on
a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of
a work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
widely used among developers working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and run the object code
and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.
However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or generally
available tools or generally available free programs which are used
unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of
the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface
definition files associated with source files that control compilation
and installation of the object code.

Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in object code form is a subset of
that work's source code.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each contributor
hereby grants you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
and distribute the covered works and such Derivative Works in Source
form or Object form.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11
of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, or as a consequence
of the exercise of, legal rights you or third parties may otherwise
have in the work.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and
you may offer warranty or support protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.
    This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep
    in the entirety all notices stating that this License and any
    non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
    code".
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
    to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
    therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional
    terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of
    how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license
    the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such
    permission if you have separately received it.
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    "Appropriate Legal Notices"; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
Corresponding Source in a medium customarily used for software
interchange.

The Corresponding Source need not be included in the object code
work's distribution (due to lack of space or for marketing reasons),
but if you convey the object code work in whole or in part, you must
provide a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any
third party who possesses the object code (1) the Corresponding Source
for all of the code in the work under this License, and (2) all the
Corresponding Source for any additional terms and conditions added
in accord with section 7. The offer must state that the Corresponding
Source will be provided (by a suitable method, which may include
network download, on a medium customarily used for software interchange)
for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing
this conveying of source. This offer may be made at the time of conveying
the object code or anytime within the three years following the conveyance.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License. They may be included as a separate written document alongside
the License or within the license notice in each file. You may only
add additional permissions if they do not restrict the Program's
conveyed rights to copy, modify, or distribute, or restrict the
exercise of rights under this License.

You may add warranty disclaimers or liability limitations to the
Program, which apply only to you and are no restriction on the
exercise of rights under this License.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the second
paragraph of section 2).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless the copyright holder has explicitly
and finally terminated your license, and (b) permanently, if the
copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered
work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

11. Patent License.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner of making,
using, or selling, of its contributor version, but do not include
claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further
modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this
definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses
in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify
and propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license in
which the Corresponding Source of the work is not available to anyone
for copying, free of charge and under the terms of this License, you
must arrange to either: (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be
available to anyone in a manner satisfying the requirements of this
License, or (2) arrange to forfeit the benefit of the patent license
for this particular work, or (3) arrange to comply with the
requirements of this License in some other way.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or procure conveyance of, a covered work, and
grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered
work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or run a specific
copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is
automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works
based on it.

A patent license is "non-exclusive" if it is not a non-exclusive
license. You may not grant a patent license in connection with a
transaction or arrangement wherein you convey a covered work, if the
granting of the patent license is conditioned on your not granting
patent licenses to other parties for the covered work.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that
obligate you to collect a royalty for conveying the Program, and you
cannot satisfy that obligation and the obligations of this License
simultaneously, then you may not convey the Program.

13. Use with the GNU General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work under the terms of
version 3 of the GNU General Public License, provided that the work
that you are linking or combining is not a "covered work" for purposes
of this License.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of this License "or any later
version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not
specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
Affero General Public License "only" applies to it, you may not follow
the terms and conditions of any later version.

15. The Additional Terms section.

The Additional Terms section, referred to in sections 4 and 5, may be
used to include specific exceptions to the requirements of this License.
These exceptions may be necessary for compatibility with certain other
licenses, or for other special circumstances.

The Additional Terms section, if present, is considered a separate
legal document, and is not part of the License itself.
